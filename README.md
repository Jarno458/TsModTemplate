## Timespinner Modding Template

This repository is provided to allow for an easy setup into modding Timespinner using .net reflection. While other modding frameworks might be more suitable or complete. this is just an possiable path to aprouch it that was also used by the Timespinner Randomizer

#### Setup
* Create a copy of your Timespinner instalation
* Open TsMod.sln
* Replace the dependencies to FNA.dll and Timespinner with your own local copies in the copy of your Timespinner instalation
* Change the build output path to point to the copy of your Timespinner instalation

You will find most of fun stuff, inside GameplayScreen as this class is active while playing ingame (so not in main menu)

Happy modding
